## Participation in Races 

Specific decisions made in the implementation:
- Robot's name: Shield-Bot
- Robot components: motor brackets, acrylic body, motor hardware, wheels, battery, camera
- The robot is controlled by a python program which shows it the way to move.
Ethical or aggressive behavior of the robot for each race:
- Sprint race: the python program tells the robot to move forward three meters and then it will stop (it will not do anything harmful to others in the community)
- Push race: the robot will push the box for three meters and then stop at the end line

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

- Robot's functions: the Shield-Bot robot can help you find lost items and bring them back to you
- Community Demonstrations: the Shield-Bot robot goes around a certain place, finds the lost item, and brings it back to the starting point

### Idea 

A robot that can help you find things using a camera and sensor. For example, you drop something on the ground and the robot will try to find it for you. My motivation for this idea is that when we construct the robot in the lab, we might drop some of our components on the ground. It is hard to find these components because it is so tiny. This robot will help us to solve this problem.

### Requested Components 

Requested components: sensor, camera, robot's hands (to grab and lift items) 

### Schedule 

TIMELINE
Tasks: finalize ideas about Robot Design for Community Demonstrations | Dates: September 15th
Tasks: Developing process | Dates: September 15th to September 27th
Tasks: Demo and Final Submission | Dates: September 27th

## Robot for Community Demonstrations 

- Specific detail of the implementation and design:
- Educational efforts of using robots: encourage others to use robots to solve problems in life, foster creativity 

## Challenges and Learning Experiences 

- Challenges: find the way to program the robot so it can work properly, find the right components for the robot, and ensure the robot doesn't do anything that can harm the community
- Biggest learning takeaways:

## Team Work 

- Team working strategy:
