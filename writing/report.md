## Participation in Races
Specific decisions made in the implementation: Our Robot's name is Shield-Bot. The robot is made of these components: motor brackets, acrylic body, motor hardware, wheels, battery, camera, and distance sensor. The robot is controlled by a python program which shows it the way to move. Ethical or aggressive behavior of the robot for each race: In sprint race, the python program tells the robot to move forward three meters and then it will stop (it will not do anything harmful to others in the community). In the push race, the robot pushes the box for three meters and then stop at the end line. 

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations 
Robot's functions: the Shield-Bot robot can avoid objects and play music while moving. In the python code, we define the max number step the robot can go, the robot will stop when its steps exceed the max value. We also define the min distance for the robot to avoid, the distance sensor will measure the distance. If the distance is smaller than the min distance the robot will turn right to avoid crash. We use Pygame library to play the music. The music starts to play when we start the program and stop when the robot stops. Community Demonstrations: The Shield-Bot robot goes around a a certain place avoids objects and plays music. 

### Idea 
A robot can go around, avoid objects, and play music at the same time. The Shield Bot robot is smart, it will go and find its way through a maze and play music. You will enjoy seeing the robot going and listening to its fun music

### Schedule 
TIMELINE 
Tasks: finalize ideas about Robot Design for Community Demonstrations | Dates: September 15th
Tasks: Developing process | Dates: September 15th to September 25th 
Tasks: Demo and Final Submission | Dates: September 27th 

## Robot for Community Demonstrations 
Specific detail of the implementation and design: the Shield-Bot robot uses distance sensors to measure the distance to a certain object when the distance is so short it will turn right to avoid a crash. The robot
will stop after a fixed number of steps. It has a speaker which can play music, and the music will stop when the robot stops running. Educational efforts of using robots: encourage others to use robots to solve problems in life, foster creativity, and set the base for creating automation robots. 

## Challenges and Learning Experiences 
Challenges: find the way to program the robot so it can work properly, find the right components for the robot, and ensure the robot doesn't do anything that can harm the community. Our first idea was to difficult for the implement process, we need to change our idea to turn the project into reality. In the testing process,sometimes the robot does not work like we expect, so testing multiple times before it goes to demonstration is the solution for this problem. The robot does not stay in a certain place, it moves. So, we need to tie the components like speakers and sensor to its body and make sure they will not fall of the ground while running. 
Biggest learning takeaways: communication in team works, improve programming and testing skills, getting the robot to interact with the surrounding environment. 

## Team Work 
Team working strategy: communication is the key to teamwork, have a clear plan while working so each member can contribute to the project and finish the work before the deadline
