## Participation in Races

Specific decisions made in the implementation: 
- Robot's name: Shield Bot
- Robot components: motor brackets, acrylic body, motor hardware, wheels, battery, camera.
- The robot is controlled by a python program which shows it the way to move.

Ethical or aggressive behavior of the robot for each race:
- Sprint race: the python program tells the robot to move forward three meters and then stop (it will not do anything harmful to other in the community)
- Push race: the robot will push the box for three meters then stop at the end line.

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations
- Robot's functions: the Shield Bot robot can help you find the lost items and bring it back to you.
- Community Demonstrations: the Shield Bot robot go around a certain place, find the lost item and bring it back to the starting point.
### Idea

A robot that can help you find things using camera and sensor. For example, you drop something on the ground and the robot will try to find it for you. My motivation for this idea is that when we are constructing the robot in the lab, we might drop some of our components on the ground. It is hard to find these components because it is so small. This robot will help us to solve this problem. 
### Requested Components

Requested components: sensor, camera, robot's hands (to grab and lift items)

### Schedule

TIMELINE

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

- Specific detail of the implementation and design: 
- Educational efforts of using robots: encourage others to use robot to solve the problems in life, foster creativity

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

- Challenges: find the way to program the robot so it can work properly, find the right components for the robot, ensure the robot don't do anything that can harm the community
- Biggest learning takeaways:
