## Participation in Races

TODO: Describe the specific decisions you made in your implementation. Also, describe the ethical or aggressive behavior of your robot for each race.

Specific decisions made in the implementation: 
- Robot's name: Shield bot
- Robot components: motor brackets, acrylic body, motor hardware, wheels, battery, camera.
- The robot is controlled by a python program which shows it the way to move.

Ethical or aggressive behavior of the robot for each race:
- Sprint race: the python program tell the robot to move forward three meters and then it will stop (it will not do anything harm to other in the community)
- Push race: the robot will push the box for three meters then it will stop at the end line.

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations
- Robot's functions: the Shield Bot robot can help you find the lost items and bring it back to you.
- Community Demonstrations: the Shield Bot robot go around a certain place, find the lost item and bring it back to the starting point.
### Idea

TODO: Describe the application you have chosen to develop and provide a motivation for it. Include references (links are okay) to all resources you have used throughout your research for a project idea.

A robot that can help you find things using camera and sensor. For example, you drop something on the ground and the robot will try to find it for you. My motivation for this idea is that when we are constructing the robot in the lab, we might drop some of our components on the ground. It is hard to find these components because it is so small. This robot will help us to solve this problem. 
### Requested Components

TODO: If you need additional components (e.g., sensors), please add them in a list below, with links to websites where these can be purchased.

Requested components: sensor, camera, robot's hand (to grab and lift items)

TIMELINE
Tasks: finalize ideas about Robot Design for Community Demonstrations | Dates: September 15th 

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

TODO: Describe the specific details of your implementation and any design decisions you made in constructing your robot and your programs. Explain how your solution can aid in educational efforts of using robots, specifying the learning objectives of your demonstration and its engagement.

- Specific detail of the implementation and design: 
- Educational efforts of using robots: 

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

TODO: Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this assignment and describe the biggest learning takeaways.
- Challenges: find the way to program the robot so it can work properly, find the right components for the robot, ensure the robot don't do anything that can harm the community
- Biggest learning takeaways: 

## Team Work

TODO: Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.
