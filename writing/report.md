# Team member names: Trang Hoang, Gary Chen

## Participation in Races

Specific decisions made in the implementation:

- Robot's name: Shield-Bot

- Robot components: motor brackets, acrylic body, motor hardware, wheels, battery, camera, distance sensor

- The robot is controlled by a python program which shows it the way to move.

Ethical or aggressive behavior of the robot for each race:

- Sprint race: the python program tells the robot to move forward three meters and then it will stop (it will not do anything harmful to others in the community)

- Push race: the robot will push the box for three meters and then stop at the end line

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

- Robot's functions: the Shield-Bot robot can avoid objects and play music while moving 

- Community Demonstrations: the Shield-Bot robot goes around a certain place, avoid the objects and play music

### Idea

A robot can go around, avoid object and playing music at the same time. The Shield Bot robot is smart, it will go and find the way through a maze and play music. You will really enjoy seeing the robot going and listening to its fun music.

### Requested Components

- Speaker: https://www.dexterindustries.com/store/speaker-for-raspberry-pi/
### Schedule

TIMELINE

Tasks: finalize ideas about Robot Design for Community Demonstrations | Dates: September 15th

Tasks: Developing process | Dates: September 15th to September 25th

Tasks: Demo and Final Submission | Dates: September 27th

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

- Specific detail of the implementation and design: the Shield Bot robot uses distance sensors to measure the distance to a certain object, when the distance is so short it will turn right to avoid crash. The robot will stop after a fixed number of steps. It has a speaker which can play music, and the music will stop when the robot stops running. 

- Educational efforts of using robots: encourage others to use robots to solve problems in life, foster creativity, set base for creating automation robots

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

- Challenges: find the way to program the robot so it can work properly, find the right components for the robot, and ensure the robot doesn't do anything that can harm the community

- Biggest learning takeaways: communication in team works, improve programming skills, get the robot interact with the surrounding environment

## Team Work

- Team working strategy: communication is the key for team work, have a clear plan while working so each member can contribute to the project and finish the work before deadline
